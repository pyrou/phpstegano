# phpstegano

A php library to encrypt and decrypt text or file into an image.

This library allows to encrypt and decrypt a string into an image (GD) resource. 
All methods (open, write, or send an image) are included into this project.

### Update 2015, a complete rewrite of this library is available throught [the project Morpheus](https://github.com/pyrou/morpheus)

The library doesn't receive any update since its first release in 2007. Yes, before github exists itself !
